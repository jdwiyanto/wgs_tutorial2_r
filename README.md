# Step-by-step guide to visualise whole-genome sequence data output using R

This repository contains the source code to the tutorial contents used for the on-site workshop on whole-genome sequence data processing and analysis conducted at Universiti Malaya, 30-1 December 2022. 

This is the second and final section of a two-part series on whole-genome sequence data processing and analysis, where I show you how to take the tabular information output you obtained after processing your whole-genome sequence data in part 1 and convert them into a graphical format using R. To view the tutorial page, please go to https://jdwiyanto.github.io/wgs_tutorial2_r/

If you have missed the first part of the tutorial which shows the steps to process whole-genome sequence data in Ubuntu and would like to start there, please go to https://jdwiyanto.github.io/wgs_tutorial1_bash/
