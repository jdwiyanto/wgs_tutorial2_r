# Step-by-step guide to screen for genes and conduct pan-genome comparison from whole-genome sequence data in Ubuntu

This repository contains the source code to the tutorial contents used for the on-site workshop on whole-genome sequence data processing and analysis conducted at Universiti Malaya, 30-1 December 2022. 

The first part of the tutorial shows the steps to process whole-genome sequence data into tabular and phylogenetic tree information we can use for our genome analytics.

In this tutorial (the second part), I show you how to take these tabular information and convert them into a graphical format using R.
